# Welcome to my portfolio!

Hæ, I’m @Patrikur, a junior level web developer.
You can find the code for my current projects as well as my portfolio in this repository. Most of the pages are published with GitHub Pages. I included the links to every project within this documentation as well.
I’m currently learning to setup a proper backend with Node.Js & MySQL to implement headless CMS solutions in two projects.
