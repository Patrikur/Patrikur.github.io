# Welcome to my portfolio!

Hæ, I’m @Patrikur, a junior-level web developer.
You can find the code for my current projects as well as my portfolio in this repository. Most of the pages are published with GitHub Pages. I included the links to every project within this documentation as well.
I’m currently learning to set up a proper backend server with Node.Js & MySQL to implement headless CMS solutions in two projects.

### Project Info
Showcase project of building an online shop with the twist that the shop doesn't want to have customers. Inspiration came from the independent video game [There Is No Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240210/There_Is_No_Game_Wrong_Dimension/). Put in several obstacles while trying to order as well as unattractive pricing and bad reviews.
