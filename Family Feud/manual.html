            or a sheet of paper to reveal the right answers or note a strike for

          <h3>Teams</h3>
          <span
            >Teams are made up of family members, friends or random people. Make
            sure to chose a nice team name. These two teams are made up of an
            equal number of team members and play against each other in every
            game. Every team must provide an order in which they are playing and
            starting each round with, e. g. player one starts round one, player
            two starts round two and so on.</span
          >
          <h3>The Questions</h3>
          <span
            >The answers to the questions are unique and represent a total
            percentage of the top given answers according to each round. The
            game starts with round one, where the top six answers are asked for.
            Contestants are challenged to come up with the correct answers to
            each question, which are placed on the game board and revealed as
            teams provide them. The questions can either be fact-based or given
            by a survey among interviewed persons.</span

          <h3>Playing the Main Game</h3>
          <span
            >The main game starts with one team member from each team coming to
            the virtual podium and facing off on the first question. The
            contestant whose team is chosen by the random generator gets to
            provide the first answer. If that answer is the No. 1 response, his
            or her team gets control of the question. If not, the opposing
            contestant gets to try and provide a higher-ranking response to earn
            control for his or her family.<br />The team that wins control of
            the question then provides more responses, one at a time by each
            team member following the order the team has given before. They are
            not permitted to consult with one another during this part of the
            game. If a given answer is not under the top answers, the team gets
            a strike.</span

            the opposing team. That team then has one chance to come up with one
            of the remaining responses on the board to win the round — if they
            fail, the other team gets the points.</span

            questions data file.</span

          <h3>Point Values</h3>
          <span
            >The point values assigned to each answer come from the percentage
            within the top given answers. The first round brings the single
            value of the points, the second double amount and so on. The
            questions are getting harder each round.<br />Parts of the rules

            “Q” to reveal the question for the current round.<br />If the right
            answer is given, the game master presses the button for the position
            of the correct answer in the ranking.<br />If the answer is wrong,
            the game master presses “X” for a strike. As soon as a team has
            three strikes the light for the team turn switches automatically
            over to the other team, giving them the opportunity to steal the
            current rounds points with one right answer. If a right answer is
            given the game master presses the respective number or in case of a
            wrong answer “X” for a strike. In both cases, the rounds point will
            be added to the team’s overall points and the round is over. Not
            revealed answers can be revealed by pressing the respective number,
            points will not be added to the current rounds points and/or the
            team’s overall points. Pressing “Enter” will start the next round.
            <br />If the last round is played, pressing enter will bring the
            game to the final screen where the winning team is revealed.<br />©
